# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built as a single-page application using React with TypeScript. The component structure follows a modular design with reusable UI components:

- **Main Application**: React Router (Wouter) with route-based navigation
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives providing accessible, customizable components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom medical-themed color scheme and responsive design
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state management and caching
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form management

## Backend Architecture
The backend follows a REST API pattern built on Express.js:

- **Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for type safety
- **File Upload**: Multer middleware for handling image uploads with size limits and type validation
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracted storage interface (IStorage) with in-memory implementation for development
- **Development Setup**: Vite integration for hot reloading during development

## Data Storage Solutions
The application uses a dual approach for data persistence:

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema**: Well-defined database schemas for users, patients, and consultations with proper relationships
- **File Storage**: Local file system for image storage during development (configurable for cloud storage)
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store for user authentication

## Authentication and Authorization
Currently implements a basic structure for user management:

- **User Schema**: Defined in the database schema with username/password fields
- **Session Handling**: Express session middleware with PostgreSQL backing store
- **Security**: Prepared for HIPAA compliance with secure session management

## Core Features
The application provides comprehensive face editing and medical visualization capabilities:
