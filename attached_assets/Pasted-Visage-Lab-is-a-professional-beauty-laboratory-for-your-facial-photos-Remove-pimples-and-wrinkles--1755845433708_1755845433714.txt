WHAT IF...

Would you like me to hide those horrible Pimples and Spots and smooth the Wrinkles? - asked the Concealer.

I'd love to get rid of them and look younger! - exclaimed the Skin.

Then the eyes need to be enhanced as well: we'll outline them and define the eyelashes. – said the Eye Liner and the Mascara.

To add a final touch, let me whiten your teeth! – said the Whitening Toothpaste.

Now you are ready for a photo shoot! - they said in chorus.


BACK TO REALITY

Of course, cosmetic products cannot speak ;) But there is magic of another sort! Discover “Visage Lab” app that will enhance a face in a photo with the wave of a magic wand! Just select a portrait photo from your iPhone/iPad or make a shot with your camera and let the app do the rest. “Visage Lab” applies eye and skin makeup, removes wrinkles and oily glare, whitens the teeth and performs smart color correction in seconds. Besides, it automatically removes red eye, if necessary. You don't have to learn to use complicated software like Photoshop to retouch your photos!


WHAT'S MORE?

After automatic enhancement has been performed, you can compare the before and after photos to evaluate the changes. Meticulous users can tweak the settings (exclude some options they think unnecessary). What's more, you can apply various artistic effects to your retouched photos to make them look more appealing. Use 'Retro Sepia' and 'Black & White' effects to vintage your photos. Also try awesome background effects for a bit of a festive look. Finally, share your enhanced photos with the world via Facebook, Twitter and e-mail or save it to your photo album.


P.S. If everybody enhanced their portraits with “Visage Lab”, how beautiful the web world could be!
